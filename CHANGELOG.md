# Release Notes

All notable changes to GeometricSolvers.jl.

This package is pre-1.0, so *every* minor release is potentially breaking in the sense of
[SemVer](https://semver.org) for `0.x` versions. The sections below name what actually changed,
so that a compat-only bump can be told apart from an interface change.


## [Unreleased] — targeting 0.1.0

### New Features

- The empty package skeleton: `Project.toml` with no runtime dependencies yet, the module and its
  docstring, a test harness with Aqua and a diagnostic JET check, and `test/backends.jl` — the
  array backends a test loops over (`Array`, `JLArray`, and the KernelAbstractions `CPU()`
  backend). `scripts/float16_dot.jl` measures the accuracy of five `Float16` dot-product
  accumulation policies (naive, Neumaier compensated summation, Ogita–Rump–Oishi `Dot2`,
  `Base.TwicePrecision` and a `Float32` accumulator) against a `BigFloat` reference.

- `scripts/spikes/capabilities/run.jl` is a capability census: for each element type (Float16,
  BFloat16, Float32, Float64, ComplexF32, ComplexF64) and R3 linear-algebra operation (GEMM,
  `lu!`, `qr!`, `svd!`, `A \ b`, `cholesky`, batched LU), it reports whether the backend array
  supports it — pass, wrong (residual over stated tolerance), unsupported, n/a, or the first line
  of the thrown error — and checks a KernelAbstractions kernel doing `BFloat16` arithmetic and
  `DifferentiationInterface`'s `jacobian!` with `AutoForwardDiff()` on the backend's native array
  type and on a `JLArray`. Runs on `cpu` and `metal` backends.
