### K2 · Metal.jl 1.11's precompile workload fails where no Metal device exists, and the test environment works around it

- **location:** `test/Project.toml` (`[preferences.Metal]`)
- **evidence:** Metal.jl 1.11.1's precompile workload (`src/precompile.jl:18`) calls
  `mtlfunction(identity, Tuple{Nothing})`, which calls `device()`. In the Bash sandbox
  `Metal.devices()` is empty, so Metal cannot precompile its workload there. The issue is
  worked around: `test/Project.toml` sets Metal's `precompile` preference to `false` (Metal.jl
  PR #915, `@load_preference("precompile", true)` at `src/Metal.jl:110`), which turns the workload
  off, and `test/devices/metal.jl` asserts that the test process reads the preference as `false`.
  With the preference `true` and no Metal cache for it, the sandboxed
  `run-tests.jl <repository> devices/metal.jl` fails with `Failed to precompile Metal` and
  `BoundsError: attempt to access 0-element Vector{Metal.MTL.MTLDevice} at index [1]`; with
  `false` it passes, with the assertion passed and the device skip recorded (Julia 1.13.3). The
  fix is upstream: Metal.jl 1.12.0 runs its workload only where `!isempty(devices())`
  (JuliaGPU/Metal.jl#1000, which closed JuliaGPU/Metal.jl#996). Metal.jl 1.12.0 needs
  KernelAbstractions 0.10, while this package bounds KernelAbstractions at 0.9, so the test
  environment resolves Metal.jl 1.11.1, and the preference stays until the package moves to
  KernelAbstractions 0.10.

### K4 · A plain `AutoEnzyme()` cannot differentiate a residual whose parameters are a `Constant`

- **location:** `test/enzyme/runtests.jl` (`BACKEND`)
- **evidence:** `prepare_ad(AutoEnzyme(), prob, r, x, p)` followed by `jacobian!!` raises
  `EnzymeRuntimeActivityError: Detected potential need for runtime activity. Constant memory is
  stored (or returned) to a differentiable variable`, pointing at the broadcast
  `r .= x .* x .+ p .* x .+ 2 .* x[perm]` of `Coupled` in `test/helpers/adproblems.jl`, with
  Enzyme 0.13 and Julia 1.13.1. Enzyme's static activity analysis cannot prove that the constant
  parameter array broadcast into an active result is non-differentiable. The documented remedy is
  runtime activity, so `test/enzyme/runtests.jl` uses
  `AutoEnzyme(; mode = Enzyme.set_runtime_activity(Enzyme.Forward))`, with which every check
  passes. The same residuals differentiate through ForwardDiff with no such setting, so this is a
  property of Enzyme's analysis and not of this package. A caller who passes `AutoEnzyme()` to the
  R3 solver with parameters will meet the same error and the same remedy; nothing in the package
  sets the mode for the caller, because the mode is the caller's choice.

### K7 · A value iterate that is a mutable static array allocates on every update.

- **location:** `src/base/bang.jl` (`update_iterate!!`, `map!!`)
- **evidence:** `update_iterate!!(nothing, v, α, v)` with an `MVector{4, Float64}` allocates 48
  bytes, 32 in `Float32`, 48 in `ComplexF32` and 80 in `ComplexF64`, and `map!!(-, nothing, v)` the
  same, measured with `@allocated` at testset scope in a cold process on Julia 1.13.2. `buffer(v)`
  is `nothing` and allocates nothing. The result of an arithmetic operation on a mutable static
  array is a new mutable array, which the heap holds, so no method of the seam can avoid this while
  the iterate keeps its type. An `MVector` is a value iterate for the call form and for the value
  methods, and the zero-allocated-bytes target of the R1 regime names `SVector` and `Number`, so
  the target does not cover this case.

### K23 · The same-type LU and QR solves overflow in the back substitution for a finite right-hand side near `floatmax` whose solution is representable

- **location:** `src/linear/factors.jl` (`ldiv!!`), `src/linear/dense.jl` (`ldiv!!`)
- **evidence:** With `H = H₄ / 2`, `H₄` the 4 × 4 Hadamard matrix,
  `J = H diag(2^20, 2^14, 2^20, 2^20) H` and `b = 0.75 floatmax(T) · H[:, 2]`, whose solution
  `0.75 floatmax(T) / 2^14 · H[:, 2]` is representable (`7.78844f33` and `4.11459e303` in modulus),
  the step of `ldiv!!` with `LUFactorization()` and `QRFactorization()` is
  `[Inf, -Inf, Inf, -7.78843f33]` in `Float32` and `[Inf, -Inf, Inf, -4.11459e303]` in `Float64`,
  on an `SMatrix` and an `Array` (Julia 1.13.3); the `JLArray` route fails the same test. `r` is
  divided by `2^k` with `k = 2`, which keeps `Qᴴ r` finite; a product of an entry of `U` or `R`
  near `2^19` with an entry of the scaled step near `floatmax / 2^16` exceeds `floatmax`, which
  points at the back substitution, but the operation that overflows was not traced.
  `SVDFactorization()` solves the system. The test systems of
  `test/helpers/matrix.jl` leave this system out for LU and QR.

### K26 · A device vector wrapped in a `ComponentArray` gets the host factor, and the host QR and SVD then fail

- **location:** `src/linear/factors.jl` (`init_linear`)
- **evidence:** With ComponentArrays 0.15.50 and JLArrays 0.3.3, `x = ComponentVector(JLArray(...))`
  gives `x isa AbstractGPUArray == false`, `copy(x)` stays a `ComponentVector`, and
  `similar(x, Float32, 4, 4)` is a `JLArray{Float32, 2}`. `init_linear` selects the device factor
  by the type of `x`, not by the matrix it allocates, so all three builders return the host
  factors `DenseLU`, `DenseQR` and `DenseSVD` around a device matrix, and `factorize!!` on
  `DenseQR` and `DenseSVD` fails with "Scalar indexing is disallowed". The same predicate,
  `x isa AbstractGPUArray`, is on `main`, in `src/linear/factors.jl` and in `prepare_ad` of
  `src/ad/di.jl`. ComponentArrays is neither a dependency nor a test dependency of the package, so
  a wrapped device vector is not a supported input. Support is its own pull request, which selects
  the factor from the allocated matrix instead of from `x`.

### K30 · A solve whose residual is wider than the start iterate fails in the `SolverStatus` constructor

- **location:** `src/nonlinear/solver.jl` (`SolverStatus`)
- **evidence:** With `F(x, p) = x^2 - p` and `prob = NonlinearProblem(F)`,
  `solve(prob, 1.5, Newton(), 4.0)` and `solve(prob, 1.5f0, Newton(), 4.0f0)` return `SUCCESS`,
  while `solve(prob, 1.5f0, Newton(), 4.0)` raises `MethodError: no method matching
  SolverStatus{Float32}(::ReturnCode, ::Int32, ::Float64, ::Float32, ::Int32, ::Bool)` (merge of
  `main` into `task/z`, Julia 1.13.3). The status takes its real type from the start iterate, and
  the residual norm of a `Float64` parameter is a `Float64`. The implicit-differentiation path of
  `solve` inherits the same failure. Whether the solve promotes the iterate, converts the norm or
  refuses the mix with an `ArgumentError` is open.

### K50 · With an analytic `J`, every `Refinement` pass evaluates the whole Jacobian again

- **location:** `src/ad/jvp.jl` (`jvp!!` for `JacobianMatrixJVP`), `src/nonlinear/refinement.jl`
  (`refine!!`)
- **evidence:** `refine!!` takes one Jacobian-vector product per pass, and the product of a
  `JacobianMatrixJVP` calls `prob.J(prep.J, x, p)` before it multiplies. With
  `F(x) = x.^3 .- p`, a diagonal analytic `J` that counts its calls, `x₀ = [10, 8]`,
  `p = [2, 3]`, `reuse = 3` and `Refinement(1e-12, 1)`, `LUFactorization()` makes 2 calls of `J`
  in each of 5 steps, the reused steps included, and `LUFactorization(Float32)` makes 3 in the
  first step and 5 in each of steps 2–5, where the refinement on the reused factor fails and the
  step factorises again (Julia 1.13.3). A fresh step already holds `J(x)` as the matrix it
  factorises; a step on a reused factor holds no Jacobian of the current iterate, and the
  refinement needs one. Whether a fresh step refines with the matrix it holds is open.

### K51 · A step without `start!!` on the state that `solve!!` returns fails closed only where the factorisation runs in another precision than the iterate

- **location:** `src/nonlinear/newton.jl` (`mixed_unstarted`)
- **evidence:** With `F(x) = x .* x .- p`, a diagonal analytic `J`, `x₀ = [3, 5]`, `p = [4, 9]`
  and the default `Static` globalization, a `step!!` on the state that `solve!!` returns, without
  `start!!`, gives `SUCCESS` with `LUFactorization()` and `NONFINITE` with
  `LUFactorization(Float32)` (Julia 1.13.3). `finish!!` sets `slow_steps = -1`, and only the
  mixed-precision step reads it; the `NaN` norm of the same state makes `residual_norm` take
  `rnorm(Fx)` again, which serves the step in the working precision. A line-search step fails
  closed in both precisions. Whether the mixed-precision step keeps the sentinel or follows the
  step in the working precision is open.

### K52 · A failed `Refinement` on a reused factor refreshes the factor only where the factorisation runs in another precision than the iterate

- **location:** `src/nonlinear/newton.jl` (`newton_globalize`)
- **evidence:** With the problem of K50, `reuse = 3` and `Refinement(1e-12, 1)`, the refinement
  on the reused factor fails in steps 2 and 3. With `LUFactorization()` the factor age goes
  `1 → 2 → 0` and `failures` stays `0`; with `LUFactorization(Float32)` the step factorises again,
  sets `failures = 1` and keeps the age at `1` (Julia 1.13.3). `newton_globalize` discards the
  `failed` flag that `newton_direction` returns; `mixed_newton!!` reads it. The `reuse` field of
  the `Newton` docstring states the difference. Whether the step in the working precision also
  refreshes is open.
