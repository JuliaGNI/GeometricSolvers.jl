## Status and stopping test

Every type on this page is `isbits`, so a kernel can hold it, and every real field is in
`R = real(T)` for the element type `T` of the iterate.

## Linear-solver methods

The factorisation precision `TF` of a linear-solver method is a type parameter. `Nothing` selects
the working type of the problem, a real float type a lower (or higher) precision, and a marker a
vendor tensor-core path.

## Line searches

A line search is scalar code: [`linesearch`](@ref) sees the line only through the merit
[`φ`](@ref) and its derivative [`φ′`](@ref), allocates nothing and never throws, so the same
search runs on the host and inside a kernel. Its iteration cap, where it has one, is its own
field.
